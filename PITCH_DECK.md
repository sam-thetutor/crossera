# CrossEra Pitch Deck
**Retroactive Rewards for CrossFi Applications**

---

## 1. The Problem 🎯

**Developers on CrossFi blockchain face challenges:**
- No incentives for building quality applications
- Hard to attract users without rewards
- Gas fees go to waste instead of creating value
- No data on user engagement and activity

**Result:** Limited ecosystem growth and developer adoption

---

## 2. The Solution 💡

**CrossEra: A retroactive reward system that turns gas fees into developer incentives**

We transform transaction gas fees into:
- ✅ Developer rewards (70% based on fees)
- ✅ User engagement incentives (30% based on volume)
- ✅ Real-time analytics and leaderboards
- ✅ Campaign-based growth programs

---

## 3. How It Works ⚙️

### **Simple 3-Step Process:**

**Step 1: Register Project**
- Developers register their app on CrossEra
- Get unique App ID for tracking
- Register on-chain for verification

**Step 2: Join Campaigns**
- Browse active reward campaigns
- Register app for relevant campaigns
- Start accumulating metrics automatically

**Step 3: Earn & Claim Rewards**
- Users transact with your app
- Gas fees → automatic rewards
- Claim proportional share when campaign ends
