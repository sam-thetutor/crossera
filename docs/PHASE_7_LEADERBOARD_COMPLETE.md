## 📊 Leaderboard Features

### **1. Campaign Stats Summary (Top Section)**

Three stat cards showing:
- **Total Fees** ⛽ - Sum of all gas fees generated
- **Total Volume** 📊 - Sum of all transaction values
- **Total Transactions** 📝 - Count of processed transactions

### **2. Leaderboard Table**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Rank** | Position with medals (🥇🥈🥉) for top 3 |
| **App ID** | Application identifier |
| **Est. Reward** | Estimated XFI reward (sorted by this) |
| **Fees** | Total fees generated by app |
| **Volume** | Total transaction volume |
| **Txs** | Transaction count |
| **Share** | Market share (fees % / volume %) |

### **3. Info Box**

Explains reward calculation:
- 70% distributed by fees
- 30% distributed by volume
- Claimable after campaign ends

### **4. Refresh Button**

Manually refresh leaderboard data

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Data Fetching**

```typescript
// Fetch campaign totals
const totals = await contract.getCampaignTotals(campaignId);

// Get all registered apps
const registeredApps = await contract.getCampaignApps(campaignId);

// Fetch metrics for each app
for (const appId of registeredApps) {
  const metrics = await contract.getAppCampaignMetrics(appId, campaignId);
  // Returns: totalFees, totalVolume, txCount, estimatedReward
}
```

### **Sorting Logic**

```typescript
// Sort by estimated reward (descending)
leaderboardData.sort((a, b) => {
  if (b.estimatedReward > a.estimatedReward) return 1;
  if (b.estimatedReward < a.estimatedReward) return -1;
  return 0;
});

// Assign ranks after sorting
leaderboardData.forEach((entry, index) => {
  entry.rank = index + 1;
});
```

### **Market Share Calculation**

```typescript
// Calculate percentage share
const feeShare = Number((appFees * 10000n) / totalFees) / 100;
const volumeShare = Number((appVolume * 10000n) / totalVolume) / 100;
```

## 🎨 Design Features

### **Visual Hierarchy**

1. **Gold gradient header** - Makes leaderboard stand out
2. **Yellow background** for rank #1 - Highlights winner
3. **Medal emojis** (🥇🥈🥉) - Visual recognition for top 3
4. **Color-coded stats** - Purple (fees), Blue (volume), Green (txs)
5. **Hover effects** - Interactive table rows

### **Responsive Design**

- Grid layout for stat cards (3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Horizontal scrolling for table on small screens
- Proper text sizing and spacing

### **Loading States**

- **Loading**: Spinning animation with message
- **Error**: Warning icon with retry button
- **Empty**: Instructions on how to get started

## 📋 Example Leaderboard Display

```
🏆 Top Performers

#🥇 jpymgtw9yhj5pmpd884z
   Est. Reward: 0.14 XFI
   Fees: 0.0200165625 XFI
   Volume: 0.0 XFI
   Transactions: 1
   Fee Share: 100%
   Volume Share: 0%
```

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Component mounts** → `useEffect` triggers
2. **Fetch totals** → `getCampaignTotals(campaignId)`
3. **Get app list** → `getCampaignApps(campaignId)`
4. **Loop apps** → `getAppCampaignMetrics(appId, campaignId)` for each
5. **Calculate shares** → Percentage of total fees/volume
6. **Sort by reward** → Descending order
7. **Assign ranks** → 1, 2, 3, ...
8. **Display** → Render table with medals

---

## 🎯 Integration

### **Campaign Details Page**

Updated `/campaigns/[campaignId]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
import { LeaderboardTab } from '@/components/campaigns/LeaderboardTab';

// Inside the tab content:
{activeTab === 'leaderboard' && campaign && (
  <LeaderboardTab campaignId={campaign.campaign_id} />
)}
```

**Before:** "Coming Soon" placeholder  
**After:** Full leaderboard with live data ✅
